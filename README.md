# playervectors
Implementation of [Player Vectors: Characterizing Soccer Players Playing Style from Match Event Streams](https://ecmlpkdd2019.org/downloads/paper/701.pdf) in python.

## Install

```bash
pip install playervectors
```

## Usage

### Fitting PlayerVectors
```python
from playervectors import PlayerVectors


pvs = PlayerVectors(grid=(50, 50),
                    actions=['shot', 'cross', 'dribble', 'pass'],
                    components=[4, 4, 5, 5])

pvs.fit(coordinates=coordinates,
        minutes_played=minutes_played,
        player_names=player_names)
```

### Plotting Principle Components

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

pvs.plot_principle_components()
plt.show()
```

    <em>Output of: pvs.plot_principle_components()</em>
</p>


### Plotting Weight Distribution

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

pvs.plot_distribution()
plt.show()
```

<p style="font-size: 12px; text-align: center;">
    <em>Output of: pvs.plot_distribution()</em>
</p>

### Plotting Weights of a Player

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# wy_id of Kevin De Bruyne (Central midfielder)
pvs.plot_weights(player_id=38021)
plt.show()
```

<p style="font-size: 12px; text-align: center;">
    <em>Output of: pvs.plot_weights(player_id=38021)</em>
</p>



## Building Player Vectors

### 1. Selecting Relevant Action Types
Let $k_t$ be the number of principal components chosen to compress heatmaps of action type $t$.

According to the paper, $k_t$ with $t \in$ {shot, cross, dribble, pass} with corresponding components {4, 4, 5, 5} is the minimal number of components needed to explain 70% of the variance in the heatmaps of action type $t$.


This parameter setting
was empirically found to work well because of the high variability of players
positions in their actions (see Challenge 1 in Section 2 in the paper).

Ignoring 30% of the variance allows to summarize a player’s playstyle only by his dominant regions
on the field rather than model every position on the field he ever occupied.

### 4. Assembling Player Vectors
The player vector v of a player p is the concatenation of his compressed vectors
for the relevant action types.
