#### Load Action Data

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('passes.csv')
x, y = list(df['x']), list(df['y'])
```
#### PlayerHeatMap: Visualize raw counts of action

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from playervectors import PlayerHeatMap

# Create Action Component
action_pass = PlayerHeatMap(action_name='Pass')

# Fit action
action_pass.fit(x, y)

# Visualize Playing style for desired action as raw counts
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
action.raw_counts()
plt.show()
```

#### PlayerHeatMap: Visualize heatmap of action

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from playervectors import PlayerHeatMap

# Create Action Component
action_pass = PlayerHeatMap(action_name='Pass')

# Fit action
action_pass.fit(x, y)

# Visualize Playing style for desired action as heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
action_pass.heatmap()
plt.show()
```
